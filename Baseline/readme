In the code we use following source code or library 

1.Seamless Image Cloning by a Closed Form Solution of a Modified Poisson Problem
Masayuki Tanaka, Ryo Kamio and Masatoshi Okutomi
Proceedings of 5th ACM SIGGRAPH Conference and Exhibition on Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques in Asia (SIGGRAPH Asia 2012)
 p.c08-0164-1-1, November, 2012.
 
the following source code was created by them:
 avoidzero.m buildModPoissonParam.m imGradFeature.m modPoisson.m 
 
 
2.Convolution Pyramids

We use the supplymental material of Zeev Farbman etc which published at SIGGRAPH Asia 2011,the link is http://www.cs.huji.ac.il/labs/cglab/projects/convpyr/.

the following file was created by them :
conv2olam.m evalf.m fftimfilter.m LaplacianDirichlet.m 

ConvPyrBlending.m include the modified code of Farbman's.

3.Mesh2D Library

We use the library mesh2d,we download the code from https://cn.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/25555-mesh2d-automatic-mesh-generation which published
by Darren Engwirda 12 Oct 2009

The "Mesh2d v24" was created by Darren Engwirda

we make some slight modification of code, so we include the library code in our sourcecode.





To run our code,you can just run "runme.m"
	we test our code using Matlab2014a.
